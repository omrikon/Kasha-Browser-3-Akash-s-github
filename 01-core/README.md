# 01-core - Core Game Setup

This folder contains the basic game setup files that load first.

## Files

- **config.js** - Game configuration and constants
  - Canvas setup
  - Pixel scale settings
  - Weapon type definitions
  - DOM element references

- **gameState.js** - Game state variables
  - Player health, score, level
  - Camera position
  - Game state (paused, game over, etc.)
  - Arrays for game objects (platforms, enemies, etc.)

## ⚠️ Warning

These files are foundational. Changing them incorrectly can break the entire game. Only modify if you understand what you're doing!
